## Abstract

The modern environment and human lifestyle have led to a variety of health issues that affect people today. When anyone is afflicted with an illness, they must see a doctor, which is both time-consuming and costly. This research promotes a one-stop solution addressing prevalent challenges in healthcare. Focused on disease prediction, online appointment booking, and electronic medical record storage, the proposed platform offers a comprehensive solution to mitigate the complexities individuals face in accessing healthcare. Users can benefit from predictive disease identification based on entered age, gender, and symptoms, facilitating early intervention.
